# Rerereskillable-Other-Mod-Item-Locks
Anyone can add a list of item locks (in the format for the rereskillable and rerereskillable config) for any mod. Make sure to copy the EXACT name of the mod and put it as a heading and add a link to the mod. Also make sure it works before adding it. 

Here is a link to a video on how to add the locks to the config: 
Here is a link to the Rereskillable mod for forge 1.16.5:https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/rereskillable
Here is a link to the Rerereskillable mod for forge 1.18.2: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/rerereskillable

Formating a skill lock is as such:

"mod:id skill:level"
  For example:
"minecraft:ender_pearl magic:5",
  OR
"quark:rope attack:3 agility:2",
  OR
"minecraft:horse agility:10"
